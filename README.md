# 🤖 NTNUI membership bot

A Discord bot designed to support NTNUI groups by managing and tracking users' membership statuses efficiently.

## 🔧 What is this made of?

This project leverages the [NTNUI API](https://api.ntnui.no/) to keep track of memberships, ensuring roles in Discord reflect current statuses.
The bot is built with:

- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) for Discord interaction.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) as the runtime environment.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) NoSQL database program for efficient cloud storage.

## 🚀 Quick Start and prerequisites

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, it is recommended to run this bot as an image.

Make sure you have the required access permissions for the API and database.

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vegardev/ntnui-membership-bot.git
   cd ntnui-membership-bot/
   ```
   
2. Build the Docker image

   ```bash
   docker build -t ntnui-membership-bot
   ```

3. Create a `.env` with the following values

   ```bash
     token=your-bot-token
     clientId=your-bot-client-id
     guildId=your-server-id
     MEMBER_ROLE=your-server-role-name
     GROUP_NAME=ntnui-group-slug
     API=your-api-access-key
     API_LINK=your-api-link
     DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
     DB_USERNAME=your-db-username
     DB_CONNECTION=your-db-connection
   ```

4. Finally, run the bot using either method

   ```bash
   docker run -d --env-file .env ntnui-membership-bot
   ```

   You may enter the environment variables directly into the run command as well.

   ```bash
   docker run -d -e DB_USERNAME=value DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password ntnui-membership-bot
   ```

Optionally, you can clone the project yourself &mdash; it is recommended to have git and Node installed.

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vegardev/ntnui-membership-bot.git
   cd ntnui-membership-bot/
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Follow step 3 from the other method, creating a `.env` file

4. Run the bot 🎉

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🕴️ Privacy &mdash; what data is being stored

Privacy is top priority.

This solution stores **Discord user IDs** and **NTNUI IDs** as key-value pairs in a remote database.

To keep track of membership validity, a true/false variable is stored for each user.

To support the future reminder feature, a membership's expiry date is also stored.
